# In order to use an integrated approach in AssignPop, you will need to have both genetic and morphometric datasets. 
 Here we give the code for how to transfrom a morphometric dataset into a dataset to match your genetic data as practice.
 
 ## Loading in Morphometric and Gene Data
```{r}
library(assignPOP)
library(klaR)

morphdata <- read.csv( "MorphTransform.csv", header=TRUE )
pop_label <- c( rep("BM", 30), rep("ITCS", 30), rep("SICO", 30) ) 

morphdata_pop <- cbind(morphdata, pop_label)

morphdata_pop$pop_label <- as.factor(morphdata_pop$pop_label)

head(morphdata_pop)

# Loading the Morph Turtle Gene Data 
TurtleGene <- read.Genepop("Morph_turtle_data.txt", pop.names = c("BM", "ITCS", "SICO"),haploid = FALSE)
TurtleGene


# Now Using Both Morphometric and Genetic data- not sure how to make sure the pop labels stay on the MorphTransform data
MorphGene <- compile.data(TurtleGene, "MorphTransform.csv")

# Attempting the Monte Carlo Cross Validation with both datasets to see if it works before log transforminh
assign.MC(MorphGene, train.inds=c(0.5, 0.7, 0.9), train.loci=c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1),
           loci.sample="fst", iterations=30, model="svm", dir="Result-folder/")



```
 
 ## Multiply by two then log transform all data points
